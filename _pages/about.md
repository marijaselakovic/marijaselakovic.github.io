Welcome to my page! I am Marija Selakovic, software engineer and developer advocate. Currently, I work at [crate.io](https://crate.io/) where I help our open source users to be successful with the [CrateDB](https://crate.io/products/cratedb) database. I also produce technical content, speak at developer conferences and manage collaborations with other interesting open-source projects.

Prior joining Crate.io I have worked as a reseacher and research engineer on automated program analysis and testing for improving software quality. These topics I discovered in 2014 when I joined TU Darmstadt as a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Michael Pradel. After exiting and very productive four and a half years, I completed my studies with the dissertation on [_Actionable Program Analyses for Improving Software Performance_](http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/8768/). Before moving to Germany, I had a great opportunity to study at [VU University Amsterdam](http://vu.nl/nl/index.asp "VU") and [University of Lâ€™Aquila](http://www.univaq.it/en/ "laquila"), where I obtained a Master's degree in Software Engineering. My master thesis focuses on _Application of MDE principles in the JEE design and development_ and was done in the collaboration with [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/nl/nl/ "IBM"), The Netherlands. Besides my master studies, I have also worked as Academy Assistant at [Network Institute](http://www.networkinstitute.org/ "network_institute") of VU University Amsterdam. Furthermore, my journey as a computer scientist started at [University of Belgrade](http://www.bg.ac.rs/en/ "u of belgrade"), where I completed my bachelor studies in Information Systems and Technology.

Last but not least, I live and work in Frankfurt, and enjoy traveling, hiking, and experiencing new things :)
