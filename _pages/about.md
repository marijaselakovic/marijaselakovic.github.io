I am a senior research engineer at Huawei Research Center in Dresden. Previously, I was a research assistant at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) where I did my Ph.D. on [_Actionable Program Analyses for Improving Software Performance_](http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/8768/). In general, my research interests include static and dynamic program analysis and testing techniques for improving the correctness and performance of the software.

Before moving to Germany, I was a master student at [VU University Amsterdam](http://vu.nl/nl/index.asp "VU") and [University of Lâ€™Aquila](http://www.univaq.it/en/ "laquila") where I obtained the double degree in Software Engineering through [GSEEM](http://gseem.eu/ "gseem") program. Beside my studies I have also worked as Academy Assistant at [Network Institute](http://www.networkinstitute.org/ "network_institute") of VU University Amsterdam. My master project focuses on _Application of MDE principles in the JEE design and development_ and was done at [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/nl/nl/ "IBM"), The Netherlands. Furthermore, I completed my bachelor studies at [University of Belgrade](http://www.bg.ac.rs/en/ "u of belgrade"), Serbia.
